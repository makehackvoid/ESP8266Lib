A collection of programs and modules for use on the esp8266 (mostly) with lua firmware (mostly)
======

esp32/
-----

Stuff done on the new esp-32.

misc/
-----

A place for me to put stuff.

noos/
-----

A no-os SDK implementation of the same app.

rtos/
-----

An RTOS SDK implementation of the same app. Had issues so it was abandoned :-(

deepSleep/
---------

A similar application written as an arduino sketch. I know that this is a bad name...

app_v3/
-------

An even later version of the application.

app_v2/
-------

A later version of the application.

app_v1/
-------

A lua app where a ds18b20 temperature sensor is read and the result is sent to a network server.
This is a test program, with more code than is necessary to accomplish this task.

bin/
----

Some firmwares that were built locally while waiting for the official ones.

mqtt/
-----

Examples of programs that read the temperature and publish the reading to MQTT.

ds3231/, ds1307/, lm75/, pca9555/, at24c32/
-------

Basic manupulation of some i2c modules.

iw.lua
------

A test program to show a `wifi.suspend()` crash. Rename to `init.lua`.

reBoot.lua
----------

A test program that repeatedly reboots (3 seconds dsleep). Used to test the wakeup problem.

reCount.lua
-----------

A test program that repeatedly increments a counter in a file, then reboots (3 seconds dsleep). Used to test the wakeup problem.

reRead.lua
----------

A test program that repeatedly reads the ds18b20, then reboots (3 seconds dsleep). Used to test the wakeup problem.

reWiFi.lua
----------

A test program that waits for WiFi to acquire an IP, then reboots (3 seconds dsleep). Used to test the wakeup problem.

clock/
------

Sketches for the MHV wall clock.

ina219/
-------

Sketch for reading the current sensor. I use a NodeMCU as the controller, note that Serial1 is used (output only) because Serial is used for the USB connector which is powering the NodeMCU. The current load is an ESP8266 reading a DS18b20 temperature sensor and sending a report as a UDP packet.

Adafruit_INA219/
----------------

Copy of the Adafruit library for the ina219 current sensor, with some added functions.
- A 'delay()' is removed in the reading path in wireReadRegister.
- The rewrite of the calibration register was moved to its own function reCalibrate_raw and made user accessible as reCalibrate. Also added getCurrentFast_mA which does not recalibrate.
- A setup for reading only the current was added: setCalibrationFast_16V_400mA

wifi-v4.3/
----------

Code used to test WiFi speed using IDF.

wifi_test/
----------
Code used to test WiFi speed using Arduino.
