# WiFi UDP Example

Starts a sketch task to send UDP messages over WiFi. It is a simple example used to show that using Arduino IDE versio 2.0.0 one gets very slow wifi connection.
It is here to compare to the wifi-v4.3 IDF project which connects fast. Using board manager version 1.0.5 is fast, 1.0.6 slow too.
